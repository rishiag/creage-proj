Blender Python script for procedural generation of island (initially).
This repository will contain Python script for procedural generation of Bora-Bora island using Landscape Generator in Blender 2.66.
To get an idea about for generating island manually in Blender, refer to this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Af6A1uvNhyM
Initially my design would be based on this island but as I progress, it would be tweaked to resemble Bora-Bora island.
If you want to learn more about procedural generation, these two article would make a great start:

The project also has a blog on http://creage-project.blogspot.in/. I will start posting as soon as I get something done.
Next step would be Voronoi Tessellation of this island.
